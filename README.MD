# PYTHON Practices
This Repo has some useful practices for PYTHON.
## 1) Day-Counter:
Get a number as seconds from the user and as an output tell how many days,hours,minutes and seconds are left until the new year.

## 2) Diet-Checker:
get a label from the user which contains five letters(G for Green / R for Red / Y for Yellow) and tell if the product is healthy or not

## 3) Ebay_Sample:
In this program, we produced a small example of the ebay site, the admin can stop the program, the user can register or enter his account and finally register a new ad, view the previous ads and or delete an ad.
